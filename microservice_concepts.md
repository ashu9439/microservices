1️⃣ Fundamentals of Microservices
Service Decomposition: Splitting a monolithic app into independent services.
Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each service should focus on a specific functionality.
API-First Approach: Define clear API contracts using REST or GraphQL.
2️⃣ Communication Between Microservices
Synchronous Communication (Request-Response)
REST APIs (Using Express.js, Fastify, NestJS)
GraphQL APIs (For flexible queries)
gRPC (For high-performance communication)
Asynchronous Communication (Event-Driven)
Message Queues (RabbitMQ, Kafka, NATS)
Event Bus (Using Redis Streams, AWS SNS/SQS)
3️⃣ API Gateway
Acts as a single entry point for microservices.
Handles authentication, rate-limiting, request forwarding.
Tools: Kong, NGINX, Express Gateway, Traefik, Apigee
4️⃣ Service Discovery & Load Balancing
Dynamic service registration (When microservices scale dynamically)
Tools:
Consul
Eureka (Spring Cloud)
Kubernetes Service Discovery
5️⃣ Database Per Microservice
Each microservice should have its own database to avoid tight coupling.
Use:
MongoDB (NoSQL)
PostgreSQL, MySQL (SQL)
Redis (Caching, Pub/Sub)
6️⃣ Authentication & Authorization
JWT (For stateless authentication)
OAuth2, OpenID Connect (For user identity management)
API Gateway + Auth Service (Centralized authentication)
7️⃣ Containerization & Deployment
Docker: Containerize each microservice.
Kubernetes (K8s): Orchestrate services.
Docker Compose: Manage local development setup.
8️⃣ Logging, Monitoring & Tracing
Centralized Logging:

ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
Winston or Morgan (for Node.js logging)
Monitoring:

Prometheus & Grafana
Datadog, AWS CloudWatch
Distributed Tracing (Debugging across microservices):

OpenTelemetry
Jaeger
9️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline
Automate deployments using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD.
Blue-Green Deployment, Canary Releases for safe rollouts.
10️⃣ Security Best Practices
Rate limiting (To prevent abuse)
Circuit Breaker (Handle failures gracefully with libraries like resilience4js)
Secure APIs with HTTPS & OAuth2
